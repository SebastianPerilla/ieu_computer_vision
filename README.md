| Jan 24th, 2025 | Write a function that divides an image into non-overlapping blocks (e.g., 8x8 or 16x16) and applies a simple pixel manipulation technique such as averaging or quantization to each block. You should reduce the color precision within each block while preserving structural information (for example, reducing the number of unique colors per block). | Please follow the following guidelines: <br>- Use python code. <br> - Do not attach any files, submit only the code that takes the input image indicated below and produces an output image saved as "img.jpg". <br> - If possible, use only opencv-python, scikit-image and numpy.<br>- Make sure your code is properly indented and commented, and executable with Python >= 3.8.<br>- Use the following code to load the image as a numpy array: |
